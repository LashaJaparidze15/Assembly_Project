Surviving the Jungle

Overview

Surviving the Jungle is a text-based adventure game written in 68000 Assembly language. The player starts with full health and energy, aiming to gain influence (power) in the jungle to become its ruler. Through various choices, players can befriend animals to increase power, fight them and risk injury, find beneficial or harmful food, sleep to regenerate energy, or battle rival packs.

Game Mechanics





Stats:





Health: Starts at 100. Depletes when fighting animals, eating poisonous food, or losing fights. Increases with nutritious food.



Energy: Starts at 100. Depletes during exploration, fighting, or searching for food. Regenerates by sleeping or eating nutritious food.



Power: Starts at 0. Increases by befriending animals or winning fights against rival packs. Decreases when losing fights.



Actions:





Explore the Jungle: Enter a number (1-100). Even numbers result in befriending animals (+10 power, -10 energy). Odd numbers lead to fights (-20 health, -15 energy).



Sleep: Regenerates 40 energy.



Find Food: Enter a number (1-100). Even numbers yield nutritious food (+20 health, +25 energy). Odd numbers yield poisonous food (-20 health, -40 energy).



Fight Rival Packs (available if power > 0): Enter a number (1-100). Even numbers result in winning (+30 power). Odd numbers result in losing (-15 health, -15 energy, -15 power).



Game Over Conditions:





Health reaches 0: Player dies.



Energy reaches 0: Player runs out of energy.



Power reaches 100: Player wins, becoming the king of the jungle.

Requirements





A 68000 Assembly emulator or environment (e.g., Easy68K).

How to Play





Start the game to see the welcome message and initial stats (Health: 100, Energy: 100, Power: 0).



Each turn, view your stats and choose an action by entering a number (1-3, or 1-4 if power > 0).

Continue making choices until you win (Power â‰¥ 100) or lose (Health or Energy = 0).
